## What is this?

## Next Steps
I didn't get around to implementing the "listings" embedded model -- I was originally planning on having this app also be an app for organizing seller listings on Ebay/Mercari/Poshmark/etc., but decided to downscale. I also want to be able to upload pictures associated with each clothing item and each listing.
